## Project topic
### Snow Water Equivalent(SWE) from Space(SWE from space)
#### Snow is atmospheric vapor frozen into ace crystals and falling in light white flakes or lying on the ground as a white layer
#### Snow water simply means water from snow
##### Snow Water Equivalent or SWE, is a commonly used measurement used by hyrologistsnand water managers to guage the amount of snowpeak.

## Importance of Snow water
#The data from snow water SNOTEL site is primarily used to decide how  dams and irrigation should be managed, and SWE is the most convenient measurement for this.
##Snow water serve as a source of water for water bodies for example 85% of Colorado river gets its source from snow melt 

**Project Goals**
*The first task of the project is to narrow down scientific needs based on the previous studies
*Data from SWE, SAR and SWESAAR will be analyzed to define the necessary observables.
*The final instrument design will be analyzed to assess how well it address the scientific needs


** Project_Motivation**
#The problem came about because of low participation of research details on snow water
#Snow water contribute a lot to river bodies eg, snow melt supplies 85% of Corolado river.
#Assess available solutions to the problem 
#And I think it needs more attention
